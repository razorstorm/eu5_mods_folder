DOCUMENTATION:
mod v1.4

all changes to vanilla files have been commentated with the lsq prefix
all files with the lsq_ prefix are new and do not replace any vanilla files/features, they should therefore not cause any compatibility issues

for UI-mod integration:
use lsq_auto_expand_widget = {} in production_lateralview.gui
use lsq_auto_expand_widget_global_construction = {}  in build_location_lateralview.gui
